# Memoria Technical Specification

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **UI Components**: Custom components with consistent styling
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux
- **Navigation**: React Navigation

### Backend & Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: SQLite with encryption layer
- **Cloud Storage** (optional): Firebase or custom server
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication
- **API**: RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for data synchronization

## Data Models

### Core Entity Types
- User
- Memory
- DiaryEntry
- FoodLog
- HealthRecord
- MoodEntry
- HobbyTracker
- SkillProgress

### Relationships
- User has many entries of each type
- Entries can be tagged and categorized
- Optional relationships between different entry types

## Encryption Implementation

### Requirements
- All user data must be encrypted at rest
- End-to-end encryption for cloud synchronization
- Secure key management
- Zero-knowledge design where possible

### Technical Approach
1. **User Registration**:
   - Generate a master encryption key derived from the user's password
   - Use PBKDF2 or Argon2 for key derivation with sufficient iterations
   - Store only the verification hash, never the master key

2. **Local Data Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
   - Each data entity encrypted individually
   - Metadata (timestamps, etc.) also encrypted
   - Consider SQLCipher for database-level encryption

3. **Cloud Synchronization**:
   - TLS for transport security
   - Data encrypted client-side before upload
   - Server never has access to unencrypted data
   - Encrypted data synced with unique record IDs

4. **Key Management**:
   - Master key never stored, only derived when needed
   - Consider biometric unlock to access derived key
   - Implement secure key rotation capability
   - Provide key backup/recovery mechanism

5. **Implementation Libraries**:
   - React Native Crypto: For core cryptographic operations
   - Secure Storage: For storing authentication tokens
   - SQLCipher: For encrypted database

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication
- Biometric authentication option (TouchID/FaceID)
- Session management with secure token storage

### Data Security
- Automatic locking after inactivity
- Secure export/import functionality
- Sanitized error messages

### Privacy
- Minimal analytics collection
- No third-party data sharing
- Clear data retention policies
- GDPR/CCPA compliance features

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for encryption/decryption functions
- Integration tests for data flow
- Security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance verification

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- Basic app structure
- Local data storage
- UI fundamentals

### Phase 2: Encryption Implementation
- Local encryption layer
- Key management
- Secure storage

### Phase 3: Cloud Synchronization
